#Problem 1
```{r}
#Load data from p8105 git repository

library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

##Exploratory analysis to look at generally what products, aisles, and how many of each product are ordered
instacart_df =
  select(instacart, product_name, department, add_to_cart_order, reordered) %>%
  mutate(number_order = add_to_cart_order + reordered) %>%

#Aisles Questions
```{r}

aisles_df = 
  select(instacart, aisle_id, aisle, product_name, add_to_cart_order, reordered) %>%
  mutate(number_order = add_to_cart_order + reordered)
#Finding the number of distinct aisles 
nrow(distinct(aisles_df, aisle_id))

#Finding the aisles where the most items are ordered from
group_by(aisles_df, aisle) %>%
  summarize(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
  
```
There are 134 aisles in the dataset with fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetables fruits as the aisles with the most items ordered are from.
